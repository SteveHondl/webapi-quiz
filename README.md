# WebAPI Quiz

## Description 

In this project I have attempted to write a four question quiz with multiple choice answers.  Writing the quiz questions and answer elements proved to be the least challenging tasks.  Handling the timer, leader board, and option to retake the quiz proved to be very tedious and difficult.  I found myself adding a lot of new code where i didn't expect to.  Overall, my quiz is functional but I am looking to improve on the code and wanting to learn how it can be more condensed.
